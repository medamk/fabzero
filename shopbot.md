## Use of SHOPBOT
- Always wear safety glasses when operating the ShopBot or observing the machine when it is in use.
- Never leave the machine when it is in operation.
- If you need a bathroom break, the machine can be paused by pressing the Space Bar on the control PC keyboard.
- Make sure the bed of the machine is clean before use. Inform if it is not clean.
- Securely fasten your material to the bed of the machine. Consult every time you are faced with a different, challenging or unusual work-holding scenario.
- Perform command “C3” Homing routine to establish the true machine home X-0 Y-0 (in the machine coordinates system)
- Jog X, Y to your personal Work Home coordinates, ie: the corner of your material & the X,Y origin of your drawing.
- Take a photo of the Control PC screen or take note of the machine cordinates system to your chosen Work Home position. Example: X - 105.499, Y - 145.376 (do not worry about Z yet). Work Home X Y coordinates are simply offset measurements from the true Home (X-0, Y-0) of the Machine.
- Zero work coordinates to X-0 Y-0
- Install tool in collet/tool holder + install tool/tool holder on spindle.
- follow on the PC screen (You will place the Z-0 plate directly under the tool on your material & place the Alligator Clip onto the collet nut on the tool holder) to set the Z-0 of your home position coordinates. You now have all 3 of your X, Y & Z work home coordinates loaded into the CNC system.
- Load part file, to choose the file you need to launch, you will see your “G-Code” which you generated in RhinoCam on the screen.
- Visually check again the machine bed to ensure all tools have been removed and that material is securely fastened to the bed.
- Start in ShopBot software, follow prompts.
- Start the spindle with the green button on the ShopBot remote.
- Monitor the machine closely until the machine stops. Laser Cutters and CNC Routers have a high risk of fire if left unattended.
- If you need to pause the machine, press the Spacebar on the PC Keyboard. The machine will pause, then follow the prompts to restart or end the process.
- Emergency stop (E-stop) buttons are located in 2 places: On your remote, next to the Control PC, and On the end of the Y - Axis gantry. The Emergency Stop buttons are large, round Red buttons which will completely shut-down the machine.
- Remove the tool-holder & tool from the spindle and store it in the tool-holder rack.
- Clean the machine and your work area completely after you have removed your material.
- Skeletons and scraps created during the process should be cut up & placed in the recycling cart.
