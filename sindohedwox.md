# Sindoh 3DWOX DP200 3D Printer

## Overview
The Sindoh 3DWOX DP200 is high end, high performance desktop 3D printer that promises to deliver the best user experience available. As a high-end 3D printer, it has a lot of features that deliver an excellent user experience that you do not find in other 3D printers.

A fairly large build volume is provided as well as a very stylish and clean frame that houses everything neat and tidy. That’s a very important aspect for such a 3D printer, as it is intended to be a machine for everybody and not look like a homemade contraption of a machine with parts and cables. Sindoh did an excellent job in that aspect of the printer.

A lot of 3D printers focus on providing the easiest to use experience but many fail to do so. This is not the case with the 3DWOX DP200 3D printer, as it provides users with one of the best user interfaces, software and generally easy to use hardware. A big plus for such a printer.

In the following sections, we will list the core features of the Sindoh 3DWOX DP200 as well as the Pros and Cons. At the very end, you will find the final summary of this 3D printer with an overall rating.

Print Volume: Whats better than printing small items? Printing big items! The 3DWOX DP200 features a 210 x 200 x 195mm (8”x8”x8”) build area to satisfy every need. This is by no means the largest build size on the market, but it is big enough for big and complicated prints, especially in a clean package like this printer offers.

Closed Structure: This might not look like such a big of a feature but it does actually matter.

The printer is designed with an enclosed structure to maintain a consistent temperature for better quality prints. Having such a clean and closed frame also ensures that nothing happens outside the printer, which is something very unusual for many 3D printers, as they almost always expose some movings parts, such as the filament feeder. Not on this 3D printer though.

Auto Loading Filament: You read it right. The 3DWOX DP200 has an automatic filament loading system. So you will never have to go through the manual procedure of cutting, retrieving and placing the new filament into small holes.

All this hassle is avoided for this 3D printer, as the automatic loading system will do it for you upon placing in a new filament cartridge into the printer. The printer does all the work for you.

Assisted Bed Leveling: The system used by Sindoh to calibrate the print bed might be one of the best manual calibrated beds on the market. The software is working with the user and is giving extremely clear information on how much to turn each screw in order to calibrate the bed.

The UI gives the user a visual representation of that to do and is actively monitoring the progress to make sure the user does what is instructed.

5 Inch LCD Screen: As mentioned above, the screen on the printer is extremely useful and easy to use. The menus are clear, the navigation is simple and the UI snappiness of the interface further improves on the ease of use mentality. The screen is also able to display a live preview of the file that is being printed as well as a live progress monitor.

Connectivity: As with many home devices, a printer should be able to be accessed from multiple locations and devices inside a house without much work. And that is exactly what the 3DWOX DP200 can do. The printer can be connected to a home network either by using a WiFi connection or the good old ethernet cord. Then everyone on the network can access and use the printer.

There is also the possibility to connect to a computer via a USB cable, as well as print from a USB stick. This is as connected as it gets for any device
