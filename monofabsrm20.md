- Install [VPanel for SRM-20](https://startup.rolanddg.com/monoFab/SRM-20/SRM-20_EN/On/sp-srm_about-apps_on_en.html) Application

- Put the (1/64) bit into the machine.
- Put the User Coordinate and adjust the coordinate.
- then put into machine coordinates and record for the save purpose.
- Then Put the User Coordinate and set origin.
- X/Y set 0 and Z set to 0
- Then the adjust the bit to touch the board.
- put Z to 2mm Up
- then press trace. delete all files and choose the trace.rml file
- then press output
- after trace remove the bit and replace (/1/32) bit.
- to origin click xy. Then Z set 0
- Then the adjust the bit to touch the board.
- put Z to 2mm Up
- then press Cut. delete all files and choose the cut.rml file
- then press output.
- output is milled as below
